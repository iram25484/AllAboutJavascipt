   <br> java script is single thread synchronous language , ie. will execute line by line
   <br> there is a call stack made for every code we write in js , call stack has different stack elemtns which are of functions as soon as that function finishes then the elemtent of it is removed 
   <br> , first js sees the variables and assign them undefined untill the fucntion is called , as soon as it is called then call stack is filled with GEC , and when it is finished this gec is removed
even console.log() is a function that is called , the syntax shows it too , therfore a stack element is inserted into the stack whenever js sees this statement and is removed when is completely executed
