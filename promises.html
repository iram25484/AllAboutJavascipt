    //often there occurs callback hell , see callback can help the code to be asynchronous but when we put many callbacks one inside another ,eg settimeout inside another settimeout which becms dependent on each other and waits for anpther to finish and if there are any glitch in between then the code bczm wrong , effects readability and maintainace
// to help this out we have promises
